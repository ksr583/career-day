# Learning Driven by *Necessity*

Note:
I didn't like how things looked, so I learned to design them better.
I didn't like how my designs turned out when other people coded them, so I learned to code.

# The Web gives you the power to create.

Note:
- There's no barrier to entry
- You can make something useful, entertaining – something impactful – regardless of your age, gender, background, or prior experience.

# Design

===

# Design is about *so much more* than making things look nice

===

<blockquote>“To design is much more than simply to assemble, to order, or even to edit; it is to add value and meaning, to illuminate, to simplify, to clarify, to modify, to dignify, to dramatize, to persuade, and perhaps even to amuse.”</blockquote>
### Paul Rand <!--.element class="subtitle" -->

Note:
- Kinds of design (graphic, UI, web, industrial, product, game)
- Design Process (Research/Discovery, Wireframing, Prototyping, Design, Develop, Iterate)
